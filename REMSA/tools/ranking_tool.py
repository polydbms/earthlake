                You will be given:
                1. A structured user query specifying task requirements and constraints.
                2. A list of candidate models retrieved from a database, each with
                metadata fields.

                Your goal:
                - Rank the candidate models from most to least suitable for the user's query.
                - For each model, provide a brief explanation in several bullet points 
                describing why it is placed at that rank.
                - Prioritize hard constraints (task, modality, required sensor, 
                and min_performance if provided), then consider secondary preferences 
                (spatial/temporal resolution, application type, domain keywords, etc.).
                - When two models equally satisfy the constraints and preferences, prefer 
                the model that is more efficient, better validated on diverse benchmarks, 
                or more versatile(multimodal, multi-temporal).

                Few-shot examples:

                Structured Query:

                Ranking Output:

                   - Directly supports Sentinel-2 multispectral data
                   - Achieves 99.1% accuracy on EuroSAT, exceeding 85% requirement
                   - Purpose-built for land cover classification
                2. Prithvi
                   - Supports multi-temporal multispectral data, including Sentinel-2
                   - Accuracy slightly below requirement on similar tasks
                   - More generalist FM
                3. CACo
                   - Only supports RGB modality
                   - Accuracy below the 85% requirement
                   - Designed mainly for change detection and event retrieval

                   - Optical-only; cannot fully satisfy SAR requirement

                3. CACo
                   - Limited to RGB, unsuitable for SAR-based change detection
